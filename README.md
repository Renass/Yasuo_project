# Yasuo_project

At the moment in develop branch we have baseline for 2 approaches, 
which are implemented in branches custom_net and transfer learning.
In kaggle branch we provide code for kaggle implementation, not colab. 
In main branch we will provide actual versions and approaches and actual state of work in readme file.
